* Navigate to https://play.google.com/console/
* Log in as AcknowledgeYourPower@gmail.com
* Login as myself
* Set myself up with a developer account (chose to select option `An organisation or business` as this seems to fit the description)

    * This would connect me to the Acknowledge organisation (I think)

* Need to enter a lot of information about the organisation:

    |Organisation Address| Address TBC (from Julie) |
    |Organisation phone number|Julie's phone number|

    |||
    |Contact name|Julie|
    |Contact email address|AcknowledgeYourPower@gmail.com|
    |Contact telephone number|Julie|
    <!-- *I think probably me -->
