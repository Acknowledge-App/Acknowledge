* Navigate to https://play.google.com/console/
* Log in as AcknowledgeYourPower@gmail.com
* Login as myself
* Set myself up with a developer account (chose to select option `An organisation or business` as this seems to fit the description)

    * This would connect me to the Acknowledge organisation (I think)

* Need to enter a lot of information about the organisation:

    |Section|Content|
    |---|---|
    |Developer name|my name|
    |Organisation name|Acknowledge/Acknowledge App|
    |Organisation Address| ?? |
    |Organisation phone number| Julie's phone number|

    |||
    |Contact name|Me/Julie*|
    |Contact email address|Me/Julie*|
    |Contact telephone number|Me/Julie*|
    *I think probably me

* Signing up costs $25 (I presume USD) as a one-off fee according to this guide https://themanifest.com/app-development/blog/publish-app-google-play
